Simply put, cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. You typically pay only for cloud services you use, helping lower your operating costs, run your infrastructure more efficiently and scale as your business needs change.

## Top benefits of cloud computing
Cloud computing is a big shift from the traditional way businesses think about IT resources. Here are seven common reasons organisations are turning to cloud computing services:

- Cost
  Cloud computing eliminates the capital expense of buying hardware and software and setting up and running on-site datacenters—the racks of servers, the round-the-clock electricity for power and cooling, the IT experts for managing the infrastructure. It adds up fast.

- Speed
  Most cloud computing services are provided self service and on demand, so even vast amounts of computing resources can be provisioned in minutes, typically with just a few mouse clicks, giving businesses a lot of flexibility and taking the pressure off capacity planning.

- Global scale
  The benefits of cloud computing services include the ability to scale elastically. In cloud speak, that means delivering the right amount of IT resources—for example, more or less computing power, storage, bandwidth—right when it is needed and from the right geographic location.

- Productivity
  On-site datacenters typically require a lot of “racking and stacking”—hardware setup, software patching, and other time-consuming IT management chores. Cloud computing removes the need for many of these tasks, so IT teams can spend time on achieving more important business goals.

-  Performance
The biggest cloud computing services run on a worldwide network of secure datacenters, which are regularly upgraded to the latest generation of fast and efficient computing hardware. This offers several benefits over a single corporate datacenter, including reduced network latency for applications and greater economies of scale.

- Reliability
Cloud computing makes data backup, disaster recovery and business continuity easier and less expensive because data can be mirrored at multiple redundant sites on the cloud provider’s network.

- Security
Many cloud providers offer a broad set of policies, technologies and controls that strengthen your security posture overall, helping protect your data, apps and infrastructure from potential threats.

## Types of cloud services: IaaS, PaaS, serverless and SaaS
Most cloud computing services fall into four broad categories: infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), serverless and software as a service (SaaS). These are sometimes called the cloud computing stack because they build on top of one another. Knowing what they are and how they are different makes it easier to accomplish your business goals.

- Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
  The most basic category of cloud computing services. With IaaS, you rent IT infrastructure—servers and virtual machines (VMs), storage, networks, operating systems—from a cloud provider on a pay-as-you-go basis

- Platform as a service (PaaS)
  Platform as a service refers to cloud computing services that supply an on-demand environment for developing, testing, delivering and managing software applications. PaaS is designed to make it easier for developers to quickly create web or mobile apps, without worrying about setting up or managing the underlying infrastructure of servers, storage, network and databases needed for development.

- Software as a service (SaaS)
  Software as a service is a method for delivering software applications over the Internet, on demand and typically on a subscription basis. With SaaS, cloud providers host and manage the software application and underlying infrastructure and handle any maintenance, like software upgrades and security patching. Users connect to the application over the Internet, usually with a web browser on their phone, tablet or PC.

In this exercise, you will login to the Azure portal using your lab Azure credentials and you will verify access to the lab resources.

### Login to the Azure Portal 

1. Launch the Azure Portal(https://portal.azure.com) in the desktop on left side. You can use the shortcut on the desktop. You would be asked to choose default browser configurations but you can skip those for now by clicking **cancel**. 

2. Use **<inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject>** as **Username** and click on **Next**.  Please use right click > **copy** to copy the username and paste inside the browser. Please allow **clipboard access** when asked by the browser. 

3. In the next step, use **<inject key="AzureAdUserPassword"></inject>** as **Password**  and Click on **Sign In**

4. On **Stay signed in** the pop-up window, click **No**.
   
5. Click on **Resource Groups** to review the pre-created resource groups for you to use in the lab. 

   
6. You are provided with two pre-created **Resource Groups** in the Lab. Let us review them.

   * exercise-02-UNIQUEID: Please use this resource group to deploy all resources during exercise-02

   * exercise-03-UNIQUEID: Please use this resource group to deploy all resources during exercise-03


7. Please note that you do not have rights to create new resource groups in the lab environment. Please use the pre-created resource groups for provisioning all resources in upcoming exercises.  

8. Click **Next** on the bottom right of this page.
